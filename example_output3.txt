Concerns are mounting as new intelligence reports suggest that Russia may not be complying with the New START treaty, which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and their delivery systems. Specifically, U.S. inspectors have been denied access to several key Russian facilities, raising doubts about Moscow's adherence to the agreement.<br /><br />'Russia's refusal to allow inspections is a clear violation of the treaty,' says Samantha Green from the Bureau of Arms Control. 'If we don't address this now, it could undermine the entire arms control regime and jeopardize global security.'<br /><br />In contrast, a diplomatic adviser cautions, 'Pushing too hard could provoke a complete breakdown of the treaty, leading to an unchecked nuclear arms race.'
