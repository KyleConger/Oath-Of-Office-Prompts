The Interior Department is considering expanding oil and gas leasing on federal lands to boost domestic energy production. Proponents argue that this could reduce energy costs and increase national energy independence. However, environmentalists are concerned about the potential impacts on ecosystems, water quality, and carbon emissions.<br /><br />'Expanding leasing on public lands will strengthen our energy security and create jobs,' says Tom Ward, a representative from the Energy Producers Alliance. 'Itâ€™s a win for the economy.'<br /><br />On the other hand, environmental advocate Lisa Rodriguez warns, 'This move would accelerate climate change and devastate protected lands that are home to countless species.'
